### Hey there, I'm Emre,
a gamer and game developer from Izmir. I studied Computer Engineering, which taught me how to code and solve problems.

I've always loved playing games. That's why I chose to make games, so I can use my love for gaming and my tech skills together.

I've worked on different projects, like mobile games and virtual reality. Each project made me learn and get better at what I do. I like working in fast-paced and collaborative teams and I'm always excited to learn new things to make my games even better.
